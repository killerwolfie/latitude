    Define a personal alias/nick

    Usage:
      nick[/switches] <nickname> = [<string>]
      alias             ''

    Switches:
      object   - alias an object
      player   - alias a player
      clearall - clear all your aliases
      list     - show all defined aliases (also "nicks" works)

    Examples:
      nick hi = say Hello, I'm Sarah!
      nick/object tom = the tall man

    A 'nick' is a personal shortcut you create for your own use. When
    you enter the nick, the alternative string will be sent instead.
    The switches control in which situations the substitution will
    happen. The default is that it will happen when you enter a
    command. The 'object' and 'player' nick-types kick in only when
    you use commands that requires an object or player as a target -
    you can then use the nick to refer to them.

    Note that no objects are actually renamed or changed by this
    command - the nick is only available to you. If you want to
    permanently add keywords to an object for everyone to use, you
    need build privileges and to use the @alias command.
